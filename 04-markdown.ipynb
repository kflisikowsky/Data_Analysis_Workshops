    "Markdown is supposed to be as easy to read and write as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as plain text, without appearing to be marked up with markup or formatting instructions. While Markdown syntax has been influenced by several existing text filters for HTML - including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext and EtText - the biggest source of inspiration for Markdown syntax is the plain-text email format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, Markdown syntax consists entirely of punctuation marks, which have been carefully selected to look like what they mean. For example, asterisks around a word look like *underline*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even block quotes look like quoted text fragments, assuming you've ever used email.\n"

    "## Markdown as HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, nor is it even close to it. Its syntax is very simple and corresponds to only a very small subset of HTML markup. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML markup. In my opinion, HTML markup is already easy to insert. The idea of ​​Markdown is to make prose easier to read, write, and edit. HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Therefore, the Markdown formatting syntax applies only to things that can be conveyed in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any markup that is not covered by Markdown syntax, simply use HTML. There is no need to precede or delimit it to indicate that you are switching from Markdown to HTML; you simply use tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements - e.g. `<div>, <table>, <pre>, <p>`, etc. - must be separated from the surrounding content by blank lines, and that block start and end tags should not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not to add extra (unwanted) `<p>` tags around block-level HTML tags."
